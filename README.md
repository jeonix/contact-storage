## Contact Storage
A simple program that uses python dictionaries and CSV files. I'm taking a brute-force type of approach as in not using
CSV-specific libraries and related methods. The aim is to help me learn with working with data and fine-tuning a user-friendly
interface. Once the groundwork has been laid, I am going to practice proper use of exception handling to tackle
the different bugs that the user can possibly face. At this time (6/22/22), there are many bugs that the user can run into
depending on their input.

- I wrote the CSV file myself which restricts the program in what specific data each column can be interpreted
- The `Menu.py` and `MenuOption.py` classes are based off a separate program that I wrote for an assignment in one of my college courses
  and I understand most of the functionality but am not completely sure if they are necessary to use for this program
- I attempted to use Tkinter for better UI but couldn't decide if a GUI could be interacted with from the command line in real time so the idea was scrapped
