## Contact Storage
A simple program that uses python dictionaries and CSV files. I'm taking a brute-force type of approach as in not using
CSV-specific libraries and related methods. The aim is to help me learn with working with data and fine-tuning a user-friendly
interface. Once the groundwork has been laid, I am going to practice proper use of exception handling to tackle
the different bugs that the user can possibly face. At this time (6/22/22), there are many bugs that the user can run into
depending on their input.
